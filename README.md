## Setting up LEMP Stack on Ubuntu
Lemp Stack Overview
You may come across terminologies like MEAN, MERN, LEMP, and LAMP when surfing the internet. These are web stacks, which are sets of tools, frameworks, and libraries used to create full-stack online applications. A database, server-side and client-side technologies, a web server, and a specific operating system are common components of a stack. LEMP is an open-source web application stack for developing web applications. It's an acronym for


L = Linux Operating System.
E - Nginx (pronounced engine-x, thus the E in the name), a web server.
M = MySQL database.
P = PHP is the programming language. When a web browser requests a web page, the web server handles the request and passes it to server-side technologies such as a server-side scripting language like PHP to connect with the server and database.
